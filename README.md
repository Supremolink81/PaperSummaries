# Paper Summaries

A GitHub repo where I share summaries of machine learning papers I have read.

Summaries are meant to give intuition for the methods described, as well as briefly detail the methodologies in the paper. 

However, it should be noted that these summaries are not a substitute for reading the paper in terms of in-depth understanding of the contents.
